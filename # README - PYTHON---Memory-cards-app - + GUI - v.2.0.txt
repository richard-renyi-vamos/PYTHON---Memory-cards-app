Hereâ€™s a Python game called Memory Matrix! This game will challenge players to remember patterns on a grid. Itâ€™s a simplified memory matrix that shows a pattern of "lit-up" cells, then clears them. The player has to click the same cells to recreate the pattern.

To create this game, we'll use the Pygame library, which is great for simple games and graphical interfaces in Python. If you donâ€™t have Pygame installed, install it by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install pygame
Game: Memory Matrix
Hereâ€™s the code for a memory game in Python with Pygame:

python
Copy code
import pygame
import random
import time

# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()

# Set screen dimensions and colors
screen_width, screen_height = 400, 400
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((screen_width, screen_height))
pygame.display.set_caption("Memory Matrix")
white, black, green = (255, 255, 255), (0, 0, 0), (0, 255, 0)

# Grid settings
grid_size = 4
cell_size = screen_width // grid_size
pattern = []
clicked_cells = []
score = 0
level = 1

# Display messages
font = pygame.font.Font(None, 36)
def show_message(text, y_offset=0):
    text_surface = font.render(text, True, black)
    text_rect = text_surface.get_rect(center=(screen_width // 2, screen_height // 2 + y_offset))
    screen.blit(text_surface, text_rect)

# Generate a pattern for the current level
def generate_pattern(level):
    return [(random.randint(0, grid_size - 1), random.randint(0, grid_size - 1)) for _ in range(level)]

# Draw grid and highlights cells in the pattern
def draw_grid(highlight=None):
    screen.fill(white)
    for row in range(grid_size):
        for col in range(grid_size):
            rect = pygame.Rect(col * cell_size, row * cell_size, cell_size, cell_size)
            pygame.draw.rect(screen, black, rect, 1)
            if highlight and (row, col) in highlight:
                pygame.draw.rect(screen, green, rect)

# Main game loop
running = True
showing_pattern = True
while running:
    screen.fill(white)
    draw_grid(pattern if showing_pattern else clicked_cells)
    
    if showing_pattern:
        show_message(f"Level {level} - Memorize!", -50)
        pygame.display.flip()
        pygame.time.delay(1500)
        showing_pattern = False
    else:
        show_message(f"Score: {score}", -50)
        
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False
        elif event.type == pygame.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN and not showing_pattern:
            x, y = pygame.mouse.get_pos()
            col, row = x // cell_size, y // cell_size
            if (row, col) not in clicked_cells:
                clicked_cells.append((row, col))

            if len(clicked_cells) == len(pattern):
                if clicked_cells == pattern:
                    score += 1
                    level += 1
                    clicked_cells = []
                    pattern = generate_pattern(level)
                    showing_pattern = True
                else:
                    show_message("Game Over!", 50)
                    pygame.display.flip()
                    pygame.time.delay(2000)
                    running = False

    pygame.display.flip()

pygame.quit()
Game Instructions
Objective: Replicate the pattern shown on the grid by clicking the correct cells.
How to Play:
A pattern of "lit" cells appears for a moment. Memorize it! ðŸ§ 
After a delay, the grid clears, and it's your turn to click the same cells in the same sequence.
Levels: With each correct attempt, you level up, and the pattern increases in complexity.
Game Over: If you click the wrong cells, the game ends, displaying "Game Over."
Explanation of the Code
Pattern Generation: Each level, the game creates a randomized pattern of cells based on the current level number.
Pattern Display: The pattern is briefly displayed to the player and then hidden.
Player Input: The player clicks cells to replicate the pattern. Each click is checked against the pattern.
Leveling Up: If the player correctly matches the pattern, the level and score increase.
Game End: The game ends if the player makes a mistake.
Tips
Testing: Try adjusting the grid_size and level parameters to make the game easier or harder.
Speed Variations: Modify the delay times for more challenging memory tests!
Enjoy training your memory! ðŸŽ®ðŸ˜ŠðŸ§©

Letâ€™s add a Settings GUI so players can configure the game's difficulty level, grid size, and display duration before they start. This setup will make the game more interactive and customizable. Iâ€™ll also add Pygame widgets to create a simple GUI for selecting options.

Here's the updated version with a Settings Menu:

python
Copy code

    text_surface = font.render(text, True, black)
    text_rect = text_surface.get_rect(center=(screen_width // 2, screen_height // 2 + y_offset))
    screen.blit(text_surface, text_rect)

def draw_button(text, x, y, w, h, color, action=None):
    """Draws a button and handles clicks"""
    mouse = pygame.mouse.get_pos()
    click = pygame.mouse.get_pressed()
    pygame.draw.rect(screen, color, (x, y, w, h))
    
    text_surf = font.render(text, True, black)
    text_rect = text_surf.get_rect(center=(x + w // 2, y + h // 2))
    screen.blit(text_surf, text_rect)

    if x + w > mouse[0] > x and y + h > mouse[1] > y:
        if click[0] == 1 and action:
            action()

Explanation of the Settings GUI
Settings Menu: This menu appears before the game begins, offering options to configure:

Grid Size: Choose from 3x3, 4x4, or 5x5 grids.
Difficulty: Increases the number of cells to memorize in each level.
Display Time: Adjusts how long the pattern is visible.
Buttons: Each setting has a button that cycles through available options. For instance, clicking the "Grid Size" button toggles through different grid sizes (3, 4, or 5).

Game Start: Once the player customizes the settings, clicking "Start Game" begins the main game loop with the selected options.

Gameplay Adjustments:

The difficulty level affects the number of cells in the pattern per level.
Display Time defines how long the pattern is shown.
This GUI makes the game adaptable, letting players choose their preferred challenge level. Enjoy customizing and playing! ðŸŽ®ðŸ˜ŠðŸ’¡
